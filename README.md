# About Solana Spellbook

_Solana Spellbook_ is a developer resource that provides essential tools, tips, and tricks for building on Solana. The Spellbook is developed and maintained by [Divination](https://divination.dev).&#x20;

The key focus of _Solana Spellbook_ is developer speed and ease. It is an ideal resource for those new to Solana (we wish we had these resources when we started) and those tired of Google-ing and posting their questions in Discord Servers over and over.&#x20;

Solana Spellbook has two sections:

#### Essential Tools

1. General Development Tools
2. NFT Tools
3. DeFi Tools
4. Mobile Tools

#### Spells (Tips & Tricks)

1. Common Development Patterns
2. Common Errors / Debug Methods
3. Dark Magic - Items with known security risks or vulnerabilities
