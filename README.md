# About Solana Spellbook

_<mark style="color:red;">**EXCUSE OUR DUST: First Edition is a Work in Progress**</mark>_

_Solana Spellbook_ is a developer resource that provides essential tools, tips, and tricks for building on Solana. The Spellbook is developed and maintained by [Divination](https://divination.dev).&#x20;

The key focus of _Solana Spellbook_ is developer speed and ease. It is an ideal resource for those new to Solana (we wish we had these resources when we started) and those tired of Google-ing and posting their questions in Discord Servers over and over.&#x20;

Solana Spellbook has two sections:

#### Essential Tools

* General Development Tools
* NFT Tools
* DeFi Tools
* Mobile Tools

#### Spells (Tips & Tricks)

* Curated Resources
* Common Development Patterns
* Common Errors
* Dark Magic - Items with known security risks or vulnerabilities

{% hint style="info" %}
All spells are un-audited and out of context. Use at your own risk.
